Hello, if you want to know how to use this. First, you need to understand how transistors work. If you know how to use a transistor, you can proceed. If not, you can watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4oO7PT_nzQ or any other video you find helpful. I hope you now understand what the collector, base, and emitter are.

Now, analyze the circuit schematic picture I have uploaded, or you can use the .sch file directly. I hope you understand the connections. If you are confused, you can email me: abdulwasi189251456@gmail.com. Please use "testcircuit problem from github guide" as the subject.

Before you apply power to the board, you need to understand the power input and output. You should check the datasheet of the transistor you are using. You should also check this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vRAACeebjI.

I hope you can now use the board on your own. Thanks for following the guide.

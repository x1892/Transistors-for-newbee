Hello, if you wanna know how to use this. At first, you need to know how to use a transistor.
If you know how to use a transistor you can proceed but if you dont know you can watch this video "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4oO7PT_nzQ" or any video you like.
I hope now you know what is collector,base & emitter.
Now you have to analyse the circuite schematic picture i have uploaded or you can use the .sch file directly.
I hope you understand the connections. If you are confused, you can mail me: abdulwasi189251456@gmail.com. I preffer to use "testcircuit problem from github guide" as subject.
Now you before you put electricity on the board, you need to know about the power input and output. You should cheack the deta sheet of the transistor you used.
You should cheack this video also "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vRAACeebjI".
I hope now you can use the board by your self.
Thanks for following the guide.
